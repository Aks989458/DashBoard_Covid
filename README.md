# 📊 COVID-19 Global Analytics — Data Analysis & Visualization

## 🌍 Overview

This project provides a complete **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **visual insights** on the global COVID-19 dataset obtained from *Our World in Data (OWID)*.
The notebook includes:

* Data loading & preprocessing
* Feature engineering
* Trend visualizations
* Country-wise & continent-wise comparisons
* Correlation heatmaps
* Rolling averages for wave detection

This project is created as part of a data analytics evaluation and demonstrates strong skills in **Python, data cleaning, visualization, and exploratory analysis**.

## 🚀 Features

### ✔️ 1. Data Loading

Automatically fetches the dataset from OWID via URL with fallback error handling.

### ✔️ 2. Data Cleaning

* Missing value handling
* Removing inconsistent entries
* Selecting key analytical fields

### ✔️ 3. Feature Engineering

Adds meaningful fields such as:

* Case Fatality Rate (CFR)
* Vaccination Percentage
* Daily Growth Rate
* 7-day Moving Average

### ✔️ 4. Visual Analytics

Includes a wide variety of plots:

* Top 10 countries by cases & deaths
* Vaccination progress (if available)
* Country-wise trends (India, US, UK, Brazil)
* Continent-level rolling averages
* Monthly new cases & deaths
* Correlation heatmap

### ✔️ 5. Key Insights

From the analyses, users can interpret:

* Growth pattern of COVID-19 waves
* Impact on different regions
* Relationship between cases, deaths, and population
* Vaccination influence on spread
